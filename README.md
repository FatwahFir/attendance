# üìç Mobile Attendance App

**Mobile Attendance App** is a simple mobile application designed to meet the criteria of a job application test. The application allows users to perform attendance check-ins and check-outs using GPS, ensuring that they are within a predefined radius from a geo-tagged location.

## üìù Features

- **Location Geo-Tagging**: 
  - Tagging locations on a map (not just coordinates) with the ability to set multiple sample locations.
- **Configurable Radius**: 
  - Set a maximum radius for each location to control the permissible distance for attendance.
- **Attendance Validation**: 
  - GPS-based validation for checking whether the user is within the allowed radius before performing check-in or check-out. If the user is outside the radius, the attendance attempt will be rejected; if within, the process succeeds.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

This application was developed as a simple prototype to meet the requirements of the test. It has **no authentication** or **authorization** (such as token management), **no localization** settings, and does not follow any specific **design references**. The main focus is on demonstrating technical functionality. It is not optimized for production environments and is meant solely as a demonstration of my technical understanding.
